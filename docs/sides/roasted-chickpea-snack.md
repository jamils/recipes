## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Drain chickpeas in a colander and let them dry almost completely. Pat dry with a paper towel if needed.

### Step 2

In a medium bowl, toss the chickpeas, quarter teaspoon of salt, and cornstarch together lightly with a fork. The
chickpeas should all be coated with some cornstarch. Let it sit for 5 minutes while you preheat the air fryer to 350Â°F.

### Step 3

Spray the olive oil onto the chickpeas. Toss them around and spray them again. Try to get a light but complete coating
of oil on them. Spread the chickpeas out into the air fryer and cook them for 15 to 20 minutes, shaking them every five
minutes or so to ensure even cooking.

### Step 4

In a medium bowl, combine salt, chili powder, cumin, paprika, coriander, curry powder, and garlic powder. Immediately
toss with spices while hot. Eat at room temperature.
