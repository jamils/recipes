## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine confectioners' sugar, kosher salt, heavy cream,
and vanilla. Mix at low speed to moisten, then increase speed to medium and beat until creamy and soft, about 5 minutes.
Using a spatula, scrape frosting into a small bowl, or as many bowls as you would like colors, and cover with plastic
pressed directly against the surface. Set aside until needed, up to 24 hours at room temperature.

### Step 2

Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Using the same bowl and paddle attachment used for
frosting (no need to clean), combine unsalted butter, granulated sugar, baking powder, and kosher salt. Mix at low speed
to moisten, then increase speed to medium and beat until fluffy, pale ivory, and soft, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk
egg whites, heavy cream, and vanilla in a glass measuring cup until homogeneous. With the mixer still running, add
liquid mixture in 4 or 5 additions, pausing to scrape bowl and beater about halfway through. Decrease mixer to low
speed, sprinkle in cake flour, and continue mixing to form a soft dough. Fold batter once or twice with a flexible
spatula to make sure it's well mixed from the bottom up.

### Step 3

Using a 2 tablespoon cookie scoop, divide dough into 24 level portions and carefully drop onto 2 parchment-lined
aluminum half sheet pans, leaving 2.5 inches between each dough ball. If needed, pause to rinse scoop in hot water to
ensure a clean release (misshapen scoops will spread into an irregular form). Bake until puffed and pale overall, but
just barely golden around the very edges, about 15 minutes. Cool directly on sheet pans until no trace of warmth
remains, about 15 minutes longer.

### Step 4

If you like, tint frosting with a drop or two of gel paste. Working with one at a time, dollop a shy tablespoon of
frosting (3/8 ounce; 10 g) over each cookie, spread into an even layer with a palette knife or butter knife, and top
with sprinkles, if desired. Repeat with remaining cookies and enjoy immediately. Let remaining cookies stand at room
temperature until frosting forms a crust, then transfer to an airtight container with a sheet of wax paper between each
layer. Store up to 3 days at room temperature.
