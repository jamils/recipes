## :pencil: Instructions
### Make the dough
1. Proof the active dry yeast by dissolving it in 1/4 cup warm water for 5
minutes.

2. Measure the bread flour into a mixing bowl, add the salt, the proofed yeast,
and 1 cup warm water. Mix by hand or with a stand mixer with a dough hook until
flour mixture comes together into a stiff ball. Add more warm water as needed to
form the dough.

3. Knead the dough for 5 minutes and let rest for 5 minutes.

4. Add the room temperature salted butter and knead for at least 5 minutes or
until butter is fully incorporated. At this time, the dough should be firm and
velvety to the touch.

5. Form into a ball, butter all surfaces, and let rise until double, 1 hour, in
a warm spot.

### :pretzel: Shape the Pretzels
6. Place the wax paper onto the baking sheet.

7. De-gas (punch down) the dough.

8. Divide it into 12 (2-ounce) balls.

9. Using very little flour, form balls into 1-foot long strands, thicker in the
middle and tapering towards the ends.

10. Take each strand and roll out again to form 2-foot strands.

11. Twist into a pretzel shape, using a little water to make the ends stick to
the loop. Experienced pretzel bakers can flip prezels into shape in the air, but
most people have to coax them.

12. Place the prezels on the baking sheet and refrigerate for 1 hour. This dries
out the surface and makes them easier to handle.

### :warning: Make the Lye Solution
13. Make sure that you put on latex gloves and safety glasses.

14. Place water in a plastic container or glass container, weigh food grade
sodium hydroxide into a bowl, and add slowly to the water, stirring with a
plastic spoon. **ALWAYS ADD THE LYE TO THE WATER, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND!**

15. Remove the pretzels from the refrigerator and dip each for 30 seconds in the
lye solution.

16. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a greased baking sheet or a
parchment-paper-lined baking sheet.

17. Sprinkle pretzel with coarse salt to taste. Make a deep cut through the
thick part of the pretzel horizontally with a razor blade. Let prezels rest for
15 minutes.

18. Heat oven to 375Â°F. Bake pretzels for 20 minutes or until deep golden brown.
