## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Pour 2 tablespoons water into small bowl; sprinkle unflavored gelatin over. Let stand until gelatin softens, about 10
minutes. Lightly spray six 3/4 cup ramekins or custard cups with nonstick spray.

### Step 2

Heat whipping cream, lemon peel, and granulated sugar in medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring constantly
until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and bring just to low boil, stirring occasionally. Add gelatin mixture; remove from
heat. Stir until gelatin dissolves. Cool mixture to lukewarm, stirring often. Stir in buttermilk and vanilla; divide
mixture among prepared ramekins. Refrigerate panna cotta until set, about 4 hours.

### Step 3

DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and keep chilled.

### Step 4

Using small sharp knife, cut around panna cotta in each ramekin. Place plate atop each ramekin and invert, allowing
panna cotta to settle onto plate. Top with berry compote (optional) and serve chilled.
