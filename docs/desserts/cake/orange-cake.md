## :pencil: Instructions - Cake

### Step 1

Begin by preheating the oven to 350Â°F and greasing the 10 inch bundt pan.

### Step 2

In a separate medium-sized bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt, then set it aside.

### Step 3

Massage the orange zest with the granulated sugar to release the oils.

### Step 4

Next, using a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat together the eggs and granulated sugar on high speed until
the mixture becomes pale and fluffy, which should take about 5 minutes.

### Step 5

With the mixer running on low speed, slowly add the canola oil and then the unsalted butter, being sure to combine
thoroughly.

### Step 6

Add a third of the flour mixture and then 1/2 of the orange juice to the batter, mixing slowly. Alternate until
all dry and wet ingredients are incorporated, ending with the dry. Take care not to overmix and do the final
mix by hand with a spatula.

!!! note

    Depending on the brand of flour you use, the batter may be quite wet.

### Step 7

Add batter to the prepared pan. Bake 50 to 60 minutes for a 12 cup / 10 inch bundt pan until a cake tester inserted into
the center comes out clean (see recipe notes for more pans and cooking times).

### Step 8

Allow to cool for 30 minutes in the pan before turning out onto a cooling rack.

### Step 9

In a small bowl, mix together the orange juice, orange zest, and granulated sugar and mix well until combined.

### Step 10

Place a sheet of baking paper under the cooling rack to catch any glaze that drips off the cake. While the cake is still
warm, remove it from the pan, prick the cake all over with a skewer, and then pour over the glaze.

### Step 11

Place a second sheet of baking paper next to the cooling rack and move the cooling rack over to the clean paper.

### Step 12

Use the original sheet of paper to pour any excess glaze that drips off the cake back onto the cake. Repeat this step as
needed to make sure the cake is thoroughly glazed.

### Step 13

Set the glazed cake aside to set the glaze and finish cooling. As the glaze sets, the juice will sink into the cake, and
the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping.

## :pencil: Instructions - Icing Glaze

### Step 14

Allow the cake to cool completely.

### Step 15

Combine the orange juice, orange zest, melted unsalted butter and confectioners' sugar in a small bowl and stir until
well mixed and smooth. In case the icing is not easily pourable, you may heat it in the microwave for about 30 seconds.
If the consistency is still too thin, gradually add more sugar until it reaches the desired thickness.
