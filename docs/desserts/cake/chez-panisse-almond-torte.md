## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Beat the granulated sugar with the [almond paste][2] until the almond paste is in fine
pieces. Or, better, pulverize it in a food processor. Beat in the unsalted butter and the vanilla, then cream the
mixture until it is light and fluffy. Beat in the whole eggs, one at a time - the eggs should be at room temperature -
beating well after each addition so the eggs are thoroughly mixed in.

### Step 2

Mix the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt, and beat in just until thoroughly blended.

### Step 3

Butter a 9 inch springform pan and turn the batter into it, smoothing the top evenly. Bake for 1 to 1.25 hours (mine
baked for 1.25 hours) or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the center feels springy when you
push it gently.

### Step 4

Let cool for about 20 minutes before releasing the sides of the springform pan. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
