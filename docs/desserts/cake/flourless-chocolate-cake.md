## :salt: Ingredients

- :chocolate_bar: 200 g dark chocolate
- :butter: 200 g unsalted butter
- :candy: 200 g granulated sugar
- :egg: 4 large eggs
- :ear_of_rice: 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour
- :strawberry: some raspberries (optional)
- :salt: 1 pinch sea salt (optional)

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 bain-marie
- 1 sandwich tin or a silicone baking mold (22 cm)

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat the oven to 350°F (180°C).

### Step 2

Melt the dark chocolate with the unsalted butter. It’s fine to do this in a microwave, but using a bain-marie (a bowl
over a pan of simmering water) is good too. Just don’t do it on direct heat.) Let the mixture cool a little, then add
the granulated sugar and stir thoroughly.

### Step 3

Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition, but without beating too much air into the mix. Fold in the
sieved all-purpose flour. Turn into a sandwich tin or a silicone baking mold (22 cm) and cook for around 22 minutes. It
should be a little wobbly in the middle when you take it out. Don’t worry about this, the gooey center is fabulous,
and it will set further as it cools.

### Step 4

Remove from the oven and leave to cool completely before turning out the cake. Let it rest in a cool place, covered with
foil. Slice and serve with crème fraîche and some raspberries (optional) or for fun a few drops of good olive oil and
a pinch of sea salt (optional) flakes.

### Step 5

Try to make this cake the day before you intend to serve it to let it rest and the flavors develop. Good luck resisting.
