## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven at 350Â°F.

### Step 2

Grease and flour a bundt pan or 2 loaf pans.

### Step 3

In a medium bowl, whisk the all-purpose flour, baking powder, kosher salt, and baking soda together.

### Step 4

In a separate bowl, mix the whole milk, vanilla, 1/4 cup (57 g) of Meyer lemon juice to make a home made buttermilk.
Curdling is okay.

!!! note

    If using regular lemons, use 2 Tbsp of lemon juice in place of the 1/4 cup.

### Step 5

In a large bowl, massage the Meyer lemon zest and the 1.75 cups (347 g) granulated sugar together.

### Step 6

Combine the eggs with the sugar and zest mixture and mix together on low and then increase to high to incorporate air
until the mixture is fluffy and pale.

### Step 7

Slowly incorporate the 1.33 cup (267 g) olive oil into the egg mixture.

### Step 8

Add a third of the dry mixture to the egg mixture and then half of the wet mixture. Alternate dry and wet until you end
with dry.

### Step 9

Combine the last bit by hand so that you don't overmix the batter and create unwanted gluten.

### Step 10

Pour batter into prepared pan. Don't need to level out the batter because it is pretty liquid.

### Step 11

Bake the cake for 45 to 55 minutes until a cake tester comes out clean when used from the top of the cake.

### Step 12

Make the glaze by combining 2/3 cup (132 g) granulated sugar, 1/2 cup (114 g) lemon juice, 2 Tbsp olive oil to a small
bowl

### Step 13

Whisk until there are no more lumps and set aside.

### Step 14

Check the cake with a cake tester at the tallest part of the cake until the cake tester is clean.

### Step 15

Separate the edges of the cake from the pan using a small offset spatula.

### Step 16

Let the cake cook in the pan for about 5 minutes.

### Step 17

Poke the bottom of the cake with a skewer to add holes for the glaze to seep into.

### Step 18

Glaze the bottom of the cake while still warm with a pastry brush.

### Step 19

Let the cake cook in the pan for about 15 minutes.

### Step 20

Turn the cake out of the pan by putting a cooling rack over the pan and then flipping the pan upside down.

### Step 21

Poke the top and sides of the cake with a skewer to add holes for the glaze to seep into.

### Step 22

Glaze the top and sides of the cake while still warm with a pastry brush.
