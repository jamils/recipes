## :pencil: Instructions

### Pie Crust
1. Preheat oven to 350° F. Place **parchment paper** on your **baking sheet**
then place the mini pie tins on top. It's best to use a baking sheet with a rim
so pies do not slide off when moving tray.

2. Pour chocolate cookie crumbs into a medium bowl and stir in melted butter
with a mixing spoon. Using a flatware tablespoon add a flat tablespoon to each
ungreased tin. You will use all of the mixture. Press mixture into the bottom of
each tin with your thumbs then up the sides. Crusts should be thin (approx. the
thickness of a dime) and should cover the bottom and sides, but not the rim.

3. Bake crusts at 350° F for 6 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly. Reduce oven
temperature to 325° F for the filling. While crusts are still warm, press a
spoon into the center of each tin to collapse any crust that rose.


### Cheesecake Filling
4. Using a stand mixer with paddle attachment or an electric hand mixer and
medium bowl, beat the softened cream cheese at medium speed until creamy. Beat
in the sugar at medium speed for about 2 minutes. Add plain greek yogurt and
beat 2 more minutes. Add eggs, reduce speed to low. Beat until just combined.
Scrape bowl with a silicone spatula, then mix for another minute. Mixture will
be silky smooth.

5. Add cocoa powder and beat on medium low. Stop mixer. Scrape down sides.
Continue mixing until homogeneous.

6. Using a spoon or ice cream scoop portion filling into prepared crusts.
Pie tins should be full but not overflowing. Use a spatula or knife to smooth
filling. You will have a small amount of filling left over.

7. Bake at 325° F for 18-20 minutes. Wearing oven mitts, gently tap the pan. The
cheesecake edges should be firm and slightly raised, but the center will have a
subtle jiggle. Cool cheesecakes on pan for 30 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for
at least 90 minutes before serving. Cheesecakes will defalte as they cool.

### Toppings
8. In a stand mixer bowl with a whisk attachment (or medium bowl if using an
electric hand mixer), combine heaving whipping cream and powdered sugar. Whip on
medium speed until soft peaks form. Increase the speed to medium-high and whip
until stiff peaks form. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.

9. Creating chocolate curls takes patience and practice. Regardless of whether
you make curls on your first try, the chocolate art you create will add a
delightful texture to your cheesecakes!

10. In a small microwave safe bowl, combine the chocolate chips and cold butter.
Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring well between each. Once smooth
and melted (like a thick brownie batter), spread chocolate thinly - about
the thickness of a penny - on the back of a **cookie tray** using a flexible
silicone spatula. Move spatula in a back and forth motion, as if you were
painting. Place in freezer for 3 minutes (set a timer).

11. Check chocolate readiness for curls. Start at the edges! Edges will cool
faster than the center. Lightly press a finger on the chocolate. If your finger
sinks into the chocolate, it is too warm. If it gives slightly and leaves a
little smudge or fingerprint, it is ready to curl!

12. Hold a sturdy spatula upside down at a 45° angle to the pan, flat edge
touching the pan. Push down firmly as you push outward slowly and steadily. If
chocolate is too soft, it will look limp, climbing up the edge of the spatula.
If this is the case, freeze fror another minute. Wipe your spatula clean and try
again, repeating each minute until you make curls!

13. Once you start making curls, lift the spatula up at the end to release the
curl. If the chocolate starts to chip as you attempt a curl, it's too cold. Let
it sit on the counter for a minute and try again. Chocolate at the edges will
be cooler than in the center. After making curls from the edges, you will likely
need to freeze for a minute to make more. Continue until you've made 12 curls.

14. Make cherry topping! In a small bowl, stir cherry preserves with water.

15. Slide piping tip inside the piping bag. Use scissors to snip ½ inch off
bag tip. Pull tip into opening. About ½ of the tip should come through. Tug tip
so it is secure. Place bag inside a tall cup. Cuff sides around the cup. Add
whipped cream. When full, seal by twisting the top.

16. Hold bag straight up and down about ½ inch above the cheesecake. With your
dominant hand at the twist, sqeeze the bag until the whipped cream touches the
surface. While maintaining consistent pressure, pipe a circle of whipped cream
around the edge using your non-dominant hand for guidance. Lift up and pipe
another circle a bit smaller on top. Repeat for all cheesecakes.

17. Fill each whipped cream nest with a drizzle of cherry sauce. Top with
chocolate art.

18. Enjoy!
