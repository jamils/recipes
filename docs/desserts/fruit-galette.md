## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, or in a large bowl, pulse or mix together all-purpose flour, granulated
sugar and salt. In a measuring cup, lightly beat the egg, then add just enough heavy cream to get to l Lightly whisk the
egg and cream together.

### Step 2

Add unsalted butter to flour mixture and pulse or use a pastry cutter or your fingers to break up the butter. If using a
food processor, do not over process; you need chickpea size chunks of butter. Drizzle the egg mixture (up to 1/4 cup)
over the dough and pulse or stir until it just starts to come together but is still mostly large crumbs. Mix in lemon
juice and lemon zest (optional) if using.

### Step 3

Put dough on lightly floured counter and pat it together to make one uniform piece. Flatten into a disk, wrap in plastic
wrap and chill for 2 hours, or up to 3 days.

### Step 4

Heat the oven to 400Â°F. Roll the dough out to a 12 inch round (it can be ragged). Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet
lined with parchment paper and chill while preparing the filling.

### Step 5

Toss together summer fruit, 100 go to 150 g but a tablespoon of granulated sugar, the salt, the lemon juice and zest,
and the 3 to 4 Tbsp of cornstarch. Use more cornstarch for juicy stone fruit and less for blueberries, raspberries and
figs. Pile fruit on the dough circle, leaving a 12 inch border. Gently fold the pastry over the fruit, pleating to hold
it in (sloppy is fine). Brush pastry generously with leftover egg and cream mixture. Sprinkle remaining sugar on the
crust.

### Step 6

Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until the filling bubbles up vigorously and the crust is golden. Cool for at least 20 minutes
on wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature
