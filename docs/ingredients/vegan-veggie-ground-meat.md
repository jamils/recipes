### Step 1

Coarsely blend cauliflower, Portobello mushrooms or jackfruit, and carrots separately in a food processor. Blend red
onion, and garlic together. Mushrooms can be made even coarser for a more meaty texture (This will need to be done in
batches).

### Step 2

Coarsely blend walnuts along with tomato paste until combined.

### Step 3

Add vegetables and mushrooms to pan and continue to cook on medium until water releases begins to release, about 5
minutes. Increase heat to high.

### Step 4

Continue to mix until most of the water has cooked out add Italian seasoning, paprika, sage, garlic powder, thyme,
oregano, and cumin. Continue to cook on high for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until all the water has evaporated and no
water remains at the bottom of the pan.

### Step 5

Turn off heat and add walnut and tomato paste mixture. Mix thoroughly to combine.

### Step 6

Add to your dish of choice. Enjoy!
