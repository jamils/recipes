### Step 1

Drain and save the liquid from a can of chickpeas or white beans ([aquafaba][2]).

### Step 2

Pour 3/4 cup of the liquid in a medium-sized mixing bowl.

### Step 3

Use a mixer and beat the liquid until it starts to get foamy.

### Step 4

Add 1/4 tsp cream of tartar and continue to mix for 5 minutes on high until it becomes very fluffy and forms stiff
peaks.

### Step 5

Add 1 Tbsp vanilla and continue to beat for 1 minute. (It will turn light brown for a minute, but then turn white again
as it beats in).

### Step 6

Slowly add 2/3 cup confectioners' sugar while continuing to mix on high until all vanilla and sugar are mixed in and the
mixture if very fluffy. Mix for a total of 9-10 minutes for whipped cream that will hold it's fluffiness the longest.

### Step 7

Turn off mixer and add 2 Tbsps of your choice of neutral oil. (Melted if using coconut oil).

### Step 8

Turn on mixer to low and beat for 5 to 10 seconds to get the oil distributed. (Do NOT over mix once the oil has been
added or you will lose the fluffiness)!
