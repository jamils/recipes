## :frame_with_picture:&nbsp; Background

This collection is a consolidation of recipes from many different sources to make it easier to reference in one
location and to guard against recipes disappearing from the Internet. The recipes are meant to be used for my
own personal reference.

!!! info

    Myself being a [lacto-ovo vegetarian][6], will often convert the original recipes to fit my diet. Recipes that
    have been passed down through the original ingredients are kept to use the original ingredients or at least
    list a vegetarian alternative.

!!! info

    Recipes, when applicable, have the original source specified to give them credit.

!!! info

    [giscus comments system][5] is implemented on this site to make it easier to make comments on recipes when
    cooking. The comments can then be used at a later date to update the recipe.

!!! info

    Recipes that I come across on the Internet and have not yet been incorporated into my site are tracked
    in the [repository issues][7].

!!! warning

    Recipes on this site might be different than the sourced recipes due to personal modifications. E.g.
    changing the amount of chili powder to make the dish less spicy or [aging cookie dough][4] where egg white
    are the main liquid component in order to control spread and concentrate flavor. -->
