Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease an #8 X 8 or 9 X 9 inch baking pan{} (I always use metal; glass pans will bake differently).

For the cornbread, in a #large bowl{}, whisk together the @cornmeal{85%g}, @all-purpose flour{213%g}, @granulated sugar{141%g}, @baking powder{1%Tbsp}, and @salt{1/2%tsp}. Add the @oil{1/3%cup}, @unsalted butter{42%g}, beaten @eggs{2%large}, and @milk{1.25%cups} and stir with a #whisk or rubber spatula{} until just combined. The batter will be runny.

Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan. Bake for 30 to ~{35%minutes} until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs.
